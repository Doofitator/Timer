# Timer
## Track how much you work - A simple program for recording how long you spend on a project.

Readme will be added to as time goes on, but here's the rundown:

The program's interface consists of (1): A dropdown menu, (2): A timer, (3): A start/stop button, (4) A history pane.

(1) Is for project selection - you can use this to select the current project that you're working on before starting the timer.

(2) Counts the total time in Days, Hours and Minutes of you working on the selected project.

(3) Should be self explainatory.

(4) Displays start/stop times - each time you press the button (3), a time is recorded in this window, as well as the running total.
