# Timer
## Track how much you work - A simple program for recording how long you spend on a project.

The program's interface consists of (1): A dropdown menu, (2): A timer, (3): Some buttons, (4) A history pane.

(1) Is for project selection - you can use this to select the current project that you're working on before starting the timer.

(2) Counts the total time in Days, Hours and Minutes of you working on the selected project.

(3) Should be self explainatory.

(4) Displays start/stop times - each time you press the button (3), a time is recorded in this window, as well as the running total.

Simply add a new project and use the start/stop button to record the time spent on it. Note that the projects' data is stored in %SYSTEMDRIVE%\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Timer.ini, so the more projects you add, the larger this text file will become.
